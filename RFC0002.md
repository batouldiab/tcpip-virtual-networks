1. Abstract  

This RFC describes an existing protocol for the dynamic 
routing table, it allows filling the routing table 
dynamically based on protocol such as the Distance-vector 
routing protocol, using the Bellman-Ford algorithm and along 
the lines of the RIP protocol. 


2. Introduction 

The communication protocol is intended for the use among 
several interconnected systems where routing tables of routers 
are  dynamically  filled  and  modified  according  to  the 
circumstances and chosen algorithms. 



3. The Architecture 

The  dynamic  routing  protocol  architectural  model  is  a 
collection of several routers and clients, considered just as 
nodes having distinct addresses.  
These  virtual  network  nodes  ensure  routing  and  packet 
forwarding.  To do so, each router must have a routing table 
that shows the best routes for the destination. 
A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, 
that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an 
Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. All IP-enabled 
devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables. 
The Dynamic Routing Protocol (DRP) is used to set the algorithm 
for filling the router table responsible for routing.

5. Protocol Specification 

5.1. Routing 
 
A routing table contains the information necessary to forward 
a packet along the best path toward its destination. Each packet 
contains information about its origin and destination. When a 
packet is received, a network device examines the packet and 
matches it to the routing table entry providing the best match 
for its destination. The table then provides the device with 
instructions for sending the packet to the next hop on its 
route across the network. 

Routers have interfaces which connect with other network 
devices. 

When a packet comes at an interface, router needs to find the 
right interface to send out the packet. 

The destination IP field of packet is checked against 
information stored in the router. 

If there is a match, the packet is sent out via the proper 
interface. 

This process is repeated along the way on each router. 



Typically, dynamic routing protocol operations can be 
explained as follows: 

 1. The router delivers and receives the routing messages on 
    the router interfaces. 
 2. The routing messages and information are shared with 
    other routers, which use exactly the same routing 
    protocol. 
 3. Routers swap the routing information to discover data 
    about remote networks. 
 4. Whenever a router finds a change in topology, the 
    routing protocol advertises this topology change to 
    other routers. 



5.2. Packet and routing table structure 
     
Each  packet  contains  information  about  its  origin  and 
destination. 

A routing table includes the following information: 

 . Destination: The IP address of the packet's final 
    destination 
 . Next hop: The IP address to which the packet is 
    forwarded 
 . Interface: The outgoing network interface the device 
    should use when forwarding the packet to the next hop or 
    final destination 
 . Metric: Assigns a cost to each available route so that 
    the most cost-effective path can be chosen 
 . Routes: Includes directly-attached subnets, indirect 
    subnets that are not attached to the device but can be 
    accessed through one or more hops, and default routes to 
    use for certain types of traffic or when information is 
    lacking.

       RFC 1     Virtual Networks over TCP/IP Layer      May 2019 
    
   1. Abstract 
    
   This protocol is equivalent to the IP protocol in the TCP/IP model, 
   its purpose is to transfer data from a source node to a destination 
   node. It’s designed to regulate the communication between different 
   routers insuring their routing and packet forwarding and the 
   communication between a client and a corresponding router. 
   It also describes the format of the data that is exchanged between 
   client-router and between router-router. 
    
    
    
   2. Introduction 
    
   The data transfer protocol is intended for the use among several 
   interconnected systems where a packet data is utilized and adapted 
   to be forwarded from the source client to the targeted router and 
   the destination client. 
    
    
   3. The Architecture 
    
   The data transfer protocol architectural model is a collection of 
   several clients with several corresponding routers.  
   A client executes applications that send data.  
   Network elements are clients, routers connected to specific 
   corresponding clients and classic independent routers which perform 
   the network management functions requested upon any network 
   configuration.   
   The Data Transfer Protocol (DTP) is used to format data sent from 
   Clients to their routers or between routers themselves.

   I- Clients: Send and receive data packet 
   II- Routers: forward packets

   5. Protocol Specification 
    
   5.1. Operation 
    
     
   When a client is generated with an IP, it is connected to a direct 
   router. When a router is generated with an IP, it might be connected 
   to different network nodes (a client, routers or both). 
    
   When the client wants to send a message, it generates a packet. It 
   opens a connection with the directly connected router and sends the 
   packet to the router. The client waits for an acknowledgement 
   packet. 
    
   When a router receives a packet to be examined, it checks the 
   destination IP registered in the PDU, then it searches for the best 
   match for the destination address -where the message will be 
   directed- in its routing table to forward it. The table then 
   provides the device with instructions for sending the packet to the 
   next hop on its route across the network. If a connection with the 
   targeted node failed, it modifies its routing table then find a 
   second best match for the packet. 
    
   When the client receives a packet through an open connection with 
   the connected router, it examines it to get the message then resends 
   an acknowledgement packet verifying that it was received.

   I- Message Packet 
   Request: source-ip{integer}: destination-ip{integer}: TTL{integer}: 
   message{string} 
   II- Acknowledgemnt Packet 
   Request: source-ip{integer}: destination-ip{integer}: TTL{integer}: 
   acknowledgement
